## About me

I'm Tao Huang (黄韬), a PhD student of Institute of Theoretical Physics, Lanzhou University, China.

My interest of research is mainly statistcal mechanics related. I do simulations and computations. I'm skillful of computer and programming.

## Scientific Fiction

I'm seriously aware of A.I., especially when they are implemented with quantum stochastical devices. I believe intelligence of human being is due to and therefore limited by thermal noise of biological systems. It takes millions of years for the creatings on the earth to have us. But just think how slow we are compared to the machines we make, and how big the Hilbert space is compared to phase space of our brain! We can't imagine how fast it will be that a quantum A.I. beat over us human being in intelligence. A year? A day? Or the minute it powers on?

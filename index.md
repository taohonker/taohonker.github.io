## About me

I'm Tao Huang (黄韬), a PhD student of Institute of Theoretical Physics, Lanzhou University, China.

My interest of research is mainly statistcal mechanics related. I do simulations and computations. I'm skillful of computer and programming.

## Scientific Fiction

I'm seriously worried about A.I., especially when they are implemented with quantum stochastical devices. I believe the intelligence of human beings is caused by and meanwhile limited by the thermal noise of biological systems. It takes millions of years for the earth to have the intelligent us. However, just think how slow we are compared to the machines we make, and how big the Hilbert space is compared to the phase space of our brain! We can't imagine how fast it will be that a quantum AI beat over us human beings in intelligence. A year? A day? Or the minute it powers on?

## About Me

I'm Tao Huang (黄韬), a Ph.D. of Science. I got my degree in 2020, at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Lanzhou University, China.

If you want to contact me, please mail to [taohonker@gmail.com](mailto:taohonker@gmail.com), or follow me at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tao_Huang109).

## Research Interests

My research interests are mainly in the fields of statistical physics and soft matter physics. I am good at molecular simulation and have rich scientific programming experience.

I currently focus on the study of solid-solid phase transitions of the anisotropic systems and the resulting changes in system properties.

## Academic Activities

- 2015-2020, visiting the Center of Soft Matter Physics and Its Applications, Beihang University, China
- 2014-2015, visiting the Complex Systems Division at Computational Science Research Center, Beijing, China

## Education

- 2011-2019, Ph.D. in School of Physical Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, China
  Advisor: Prof. Yong Chen
  Thesis: A Molecular Dynamics Study on Phase Transitions and Structures of Patchy Particles
- 2005-2010, B.S. in Physics, Sun Yat-sen University, China

## Scientific Fiction

I'm seriously worried about AI, especially when they are implemented with quantum stochastical devices. I believe the intelligence of human beings is driven by and thus limited by the thermal noise of biological systems. It takes millions of years for the earth to get the point that you can understand this sentence. However, just think how slow we are compared to the machines we make, and how big a Hilbert space can be compared to the phase space of our classical and thermal brain! We can't imagine how fast it will be that a quantum AI beat over us human beings in intelligence. A year? A day? Or the minute it's powered on? More Ironically, you won't know if it's a **REAL AI** unless you power it on!
